# New Update!
12/24/2023
Code optimization.

Added a solver for Quadratic equations

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now the calculator have a new section called physics, for now in this section you can only Convert km/h to m/s or m/s to km/h,
maybe in the future she will able to do some formulas
# How does it work?
The scipt allow you do some math operation, for now he can do
```
1) Square root
2) Raise a number by a power
3) Round a number for excess or defect
4) How further a number is from zero
5) Simple math operation
* NEW 6) Convert km/h to m/s or m/s to km/h
```
# Still in beta
For now this is all he can do, there will be future update
